### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi. My name is Alex Nelson, and I am a student of computer science. I am currently taking a computer science course at the open level (ICS2O) at St Mother Teresa Highschool located in Ottawa, Ontario. I am 15 years old, and I am relatively new to programming. However I have learned to create webpages using ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) and ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white), as well as basic algorithms with ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) and ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on many assignments that I get from my teacher, including a small remake of the gmae "Space Invaders" in ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E).
- ðŸ§  I know enough about ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) and ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) to create a basic webpage. A webpage with a title, icon, words, images, etc. I also know a tiny bit about other languages like lua and python through my own research.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a basic level of ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) and ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/c%23-%23239120.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white) as a part of the assignments I have been given.
